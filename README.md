# Text-Classification-Using-Tensorflow
A Deep Learning-based Text Classification project built with TensorFlow and Keras. This project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, build and train an LSTM-based neural network, and evaluate performance using real-world datasets like IMDB movie reviews for sentiment analysis.
